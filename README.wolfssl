Support for WolfSSL is implemented and maintained by WolfSSL Inc. The support is
implemented using WolfSSL's compatiblity layer. The WolfSSL support in OpenVPN
receives very limited testing/support from the OpenVPN community itself.

If bugs in OpenVPN when using WolfSSL are encountered, the user should try to
also compile OpenVPN with OpenSSL to determinate if these are bugs in the
WolfSSL TLS implemenation or OpenVPN itself.

To Build and Install,

	./configure --with-crypto-library=wolfssl
	make
	make install

*************************************************************************
Due to limitations in the wolfSSL TLS library or its compability layer, the
following features are missing

 * blowfish support (BF-CBC), you must use something like
   cipher AES-128-CBC to avoid trying to use BF-CBC
 * Windows CryptoAPI support
